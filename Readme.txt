Read Problem.docx to understand the problem statement and my sample solution for it.

To verify the output of the program

1) Use an online C compiler
   (The first result of a google search)

	http://www.compileonline.com/compile_c_online.php

2) Open the text file "Randomgraph.txt" that has been submitted along with this zip file.

3) Copy the code to the execution environment of the online c compiler.

4) Give STDIN input (At the lower right bottom of the web page)
	input parameters -> "Number of vertices" "Density"
	example1 -> 5 0.3
	example2 -> 6 0.5
5) Click the Compile&Execute button for the output.

6) For various trials, repeat step 4 and step 5.

NOTE:
If you are using Turbo C++ compiler, Just copy the files in side the folder TURBOC files into the BIN folder and open it via TURBO C++ for execution

Thank you.
